    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by (https://www.codecademy.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional."

    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributions\n",
    "- counts\n",
    "- relationship between species\n",
    "- conservation status of species\n",
    "- observations of species in parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was also able to answer the questions first posed in the beginning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "    - There are 5,633 species without conservation concerns, 161 species of concern, 16 endangered species, 10 threatened species, and 4 species in recovery.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    - Birds, Vascular Plants, and Mammals have the highest absolute numbers of protected species.\n",
    "    - Approximately 17% of mammals and 15% of birds are under protection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "    - The chi-squared tests indicate that there is no significant relationship between conservation status and category for mammals and birds. However, there is a statistically significant difference between reptiles and mammals.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "    -  The most prevalent animals based on common names include Bats and Shrews.\n",
    "    - Yellowstone National Park has the highest number of bat observations (8,362), while the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has the lowest (2,411).\n",
    "    - All parks, except the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, have more sightings of protected bats than non-protected bats.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Additional conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The national parks host a diverse range of species, with a significant number of species falling under conservation concerns.\n",
    "- While absolute numbers of protected species vary by category, the protection rate provides a more meaningful insight. Efforts might be needed to enhance conservation initiatives, especially for mammals and birds.\n",
    "- The chi-squared tests suggest that, in some cases, there is a significant relationship between conservation status and category.\n"

    "## Further Research \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis is limited to observations from the past 7 days, preventing a comprehensive examination of temporal trends. Future research could benefit from expanding the time frame to analyze changes in the conservation status of various species over an extended period. Additionally, considering the size of each park is crucial, as the absence of information on park areas may influence observations. For instance, Yellowstone National Park is assumed to be larger, potentially leading to more observations and a richer biodiversity. Introducing the spatial dimension to the analysis by recording precise locations could offer insights into the spatial distribution of species. Examining whether these observations exhibit spatial clustering patterns would contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the ecological dynamics within the national parks."
